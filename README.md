# Direct Public Voting Platform

## Goals and Requirements

Goals of this project: 
 * Implement a voting platform that will allow general population to directly define state policy decisions (direct democracy).
 * The platform must guarantee protection from any kind of fraud or manipulation.
 * The platform must protect voters by guaranteed anonymity.
 * The platform should be easily scalable from small organization to state-level polls. 


It must be possible for any observer to prove that:
 * his/her vote is accounted correctly. 
 * all votes belong to real voters. 
 * each vote is accounted correctly. 
 * no one voted more than once.
 * total results of any poll are correct.


It must be not possible for anyone including owner of the platform:
 * to determine which vote belongs to which person.
